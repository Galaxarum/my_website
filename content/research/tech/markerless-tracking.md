title: Markerless Tracking
headline: Tracking bodies without attachments.
description: Detecting the user's body in the space is crucial, but doing it in real time, with multiple people at a time,

The main focus of my PhD was the development of a Markerless body tracking technology for the [Magic Room](/research/mse).

This resulted in an highly innovative technology:
- It works in real-time on consumer-grade hardware.
- It can handle multiple users at a time.
- Its data can be easily accessed from other applications, allowing transparent integration in other technological stacks.
