The Magic Room is an Interactive Multisensory Environment developed at Politecnico di Milano.
It features audiovisual capabilities, can be enriched with smart objects, and can interact with many smart-home
appliances. 

Exploiting my [body tracking](/research/tech/markerless-tracking) technology, the room can utilize the children's body to interact
with different activities, which are presented to them in the form of immersive games.
