In cooperation with the [Department of Psychology of Bicocca University](https://www.psicologia.unimib.it/it), I collected
a dataset of videos of people reviving memories having a specific emotion attached.

This dataset, entirely composed of Italian people, was then analyzed through text, audio and video emotion recognition 
technologies and the results were compared to a multimodal approach.
