My work focuses in Interactive Smart Spaces and Mulsisensory environments, and how these systems can benefit children
with NeuroDevelopmental Disorders and other fragile populations.

Having a technical background I focus on the development and enhancement of this kind of system, working side-by-side 
with Teachers, Psychologists and Pedagogic researchers and practitioners to pursuit various goals, such as:

- Improve the children's experience.
- Expand the available information about the children's internal and external state.
- Facilitate the usage of the system by healthcare operators.
- Facilitate the adoption of the system by therapeutic centers.
- Studying short and long term benefits induced by these system's usage.
